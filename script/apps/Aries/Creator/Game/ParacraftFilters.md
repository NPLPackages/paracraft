# Paracraft Filters
Filters are integration points in Paracraft, which allows paracraft mod/app developers to customize the application cooperatively. 
Filters is a design pattern of input-output chains. Please see [script/ide/System/Core/Filters.lua](https://github.com/NPLPackages/main/blob/master/script/ide/System/Core/Filters.lua) for details.

> One can search for `GameLogic.GetFilters():apply_filters`, such as below:

```lua
xmlRoot = GameLogic.GetFilters():apply_filters("block_types", xmlRoot);
```

## How to Use Filters In Paracraft
There is a global function called `GameLogic.GetFilters()` which returns the primary filter in Paracraft. 
One should `add_filter` before `apply_filter`, so one should call `add_filter` code as early as possible to install all filters used by your plugin, such as when Mod is initialized or application just started. 

The following example code, registered a new item.
```lua
-- register a new block item, id < 512 is internal blocks, which is not recommended to modify. 
GameLogic.GetFilters():add_filter("block_types", function(xmlRoot) 
	local blocks = commonlib.XPath.selectNode(xmlRoot, "/blocks/");
	if(blocks) then
		blocks[#blocks+1] = {name="block", attr={
			id = 512, threeSideTex = "true",
			text = "Demo Item", name = "DemoItem",
			texture="Texture/blocks/bookshelf_three.png",
			obstruction="true", solid="true", cubeMode="true",
		}}
		LOG.std(nil, "info", "DemoItem", "a new block is registered");
	end
	return xmlRoot;
end)
```
